##Candidate task

Your task is to create easy application for managing loans. 
There are 4 operations: 
* Presenting all organisation loans
* Preview loan details
* Create new loan

Each loan is in the context of some organisation. 
There are 2 organisations: **org-1** and **org 2**. 

Your work is to implement screens based on the wireframe from *wireframe-frontend.jpg* 
file.
Most important functionality is creating and deleting loan.

As additional requirement it's needed that users from one organisation do not see other organisation loans.

Please use react-router to navigate between screens.
